# qldsmash-stats
Ruby (sinatra) based app that displays player stats using the data from qldsmash. If you want to suggest features or anything like that, just send me a message here :D






Future plans:

- Disregard everything and watch movies
- Implement an API that returns json for a variety of requests (player head-to-head, date, majors, etc)
- Actual frontend
  - Functionality to arrage data by win/loss, location, etc
  - Major exlusive stats
  - Getting rid of the gross playerID entry for head-to-head stats
- Cleaning up and improving current codebase
- Minor, but useful stuff (recent searches, name prediction, etc)
